Idea :
	Extension of blablacar to within cities.
Currently blablacar a is aggregator service which offers city-to-city journeys.
Why cant we have something like that within cities???????

How it works?

Lets say 10 persons from one area "abc" are travelling daily to area "xyz" for work.
They dont know each other and hence they travel alone in their own vehicles.
Now lets say they have a platform where they all could do car pooling. Then they could think of using car pool.

How do we achieve it?

One guy who owns a car wants to share the expenses of his journey from "abc" to "xyz" posts an ad few hours before the departure
mentioning all the details like "from", "to", "via path", "price", etc.
Guys who lives across or on the same way could book a seat in that car and share the expenses.

This concept has worked in 19-20 countries but its across cities.
So why cant we have the same concept within city to reduce traffic and to help people do car pool in a better and efficient manner.
